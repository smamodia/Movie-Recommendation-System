# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project implements a movie recommendation system using the cosine similarity algorithm. It's a content-based filtering approach that recommends movies similar to a user's preferences.

Project Overview:
This system uses movie metadata (genres, keywords, directors, etc.) to represent each movie as a vector. Cosine similarity is then calculated between movie vectors to find those most similar to the user's chosen movie(s).

Features:

Recommends movies based on a user's selection
Utilizes cosine similarity for measuring movie similarity

Dependencies
Python 3.x (recommended)
Libraries (specific libraries will depend on your implementation, some options include):
pandas (data manipulation)
numpy (numerical computations)
scikit-learn (cosine similarity calculation)


Installation
Clone this repository:
git clone "https://github.com/smamodia/Movie-Recommendation-System.git"

Install required libraries (replace library_name with the actual library):
pip install library_name


Usage
Run the main script (replace script_name.py with the actual script):
python script_name.py

The script will prompt you for a movie title or ID.

The script will recommend movies most similar to your selection.
